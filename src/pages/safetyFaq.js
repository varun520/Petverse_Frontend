      question: "How is pet food regulated?",
      answer:
        "Pet food is among the most highly regulated of all food categories in the United States, including at both the federal and state levels. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates both finished pet food products (including treats and chews) and their ingredients. Nearly all states also require products sold therein to be registered, and for their labels to adhere to strict requirements regarding product names and ingredients. An ingredient cannot be used in pet food until it has been accepted by the FDA and/or adopted by the Association of American Feed Officials (AAFCO), the organization of state regulatory officials that develops model regulations for pet food and animal feed that can be included in state law.

      question: "Why are there pet food recalls?",
      answer:
        "Recalls are an important part of the food safety system. Recalls can result from instances such as testing by the pet food maker, a product that is out of specification with a company’s food safety plan, a mislabeled product, the improper balance of nutrients, or independent testing and notification by a regulatory official. The vast majority of recalls are voluntary, and the pet food maker initiates the recall based on evidence there may be a problem. In the event of a recall, PFI members rapidly work internally, with distributors and retailers, and with regulators to remove a product from the shelf as quickly as possible. To find pet food recall information, visit the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. If the product you purchased has been recalled, review the label code and contact the manufacturer.",

      question: "Are artificial falovors, colors and preservatives safe?",
      answer:
        "Pet food makers consider a range of options when selecting ingredients for a dog or cat food, such as nutritional profile, appearance or tastiness for pets. As with other pet food ingredients, artificial flavors, colors or preservatives are strictly regulated. In order for these products to be used in a pet food recipe, they must be defined by regulatory bodies, be recognized by experts as safe for its intended use or have approval as a food additive by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration.",

      question: "How do I safely store pet food at home?",
      answer:
        "Where and how pet food is stored can make a big difference in keeping food safe for cats and dogs. Before purchasing or opening a package of pet food, examine the package closely to ensure there are no tears or damages. Unopened wet and dry pet food should be stored in a cool, dry location indoors, and kept off garage floors. Washing pet food storage containers between each bag of food is a helpful way to remember to check for damage and insect activity. When possible, store dry food in the original bag and within a plastic or metal bin with a lid. Wet or fresh food can be covered and stored in the refrigerator according to label guidelines.",
