      question: "What should I look for on the pet food label?",
      answer:
        "Pet food labels are full of information, much of it mandated at the state and federal levels. Dogs and cats require more than 40 essential nutrients, and a pet food product that is labeled as “complete and balanced” contains those nutrients at the proper amounts for their life stage. Click here to watch a quick video on how to understand what’s on a pet food label.\n Shoppers have an array of options when considering food for their dog or cat. When selecting food for your pet, look for the nutritional adequacy statement, indicated life stage and the guaranteed analysis to ensure your pet is getting the nutrition he or she needs. The nutritional adequacy statement will indicate that the food is complete and balanced for a particular life stage, such as growth, reproduction, adult maintenance or a combination of these. If the food does not meet the complete and balanced requirements, it is intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only. Ensure that you follow the feeding directions indicated on the package and that the food you select is appropriate for your pet’s life stage.\n Finally, the guaranteed analysis (GA) indicates to regulators reviewing each label that the product complies with nutrient requirements and voluntary label claims. The GA also ensures you, the pet owner, can find the levels of, at a minimum, four key nutrients in your pet’s food: protein, fat, fiber and moisture.",

      question: "What are by-products?",
      answer:
        "By-products are ingredients produced during the making of food for human consumption. Often referred to as “by-products” or “co-products,” animal by-products are parts of the animal that Americans choose not to eat but may be considered delicacies by others around the world. They also include plant-based ingredients made from the production of human food, such as brewery or bakery ingredients. By-products can be an excellent source of nutrition for cats and dogs, plus pets can find them delicious. By using by-products, pet food makers can support common sustainability goals, avoid competing with the human food supply, prevent additional land from being placed under agricultural production, and avoid safe, nutritious ingredients from going to waste.",

      question: "How often should I give my pet a treat or chew?",
      answer:

However, treats and chews should be given in moderation and not substitute for a complete and balanced diet.
